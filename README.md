# Safety Measures for VTOL UAV Lifting a Cable-Suspended Load with Unexpected Mass

Author: Henrik SÃ¶derlund

Among the causes of helicopter lifting accidents, some of the
most hazardous conditions are induced swing of the payload as it clears
the ground and overloading the helicopter. This paper evaluates the need
for safety measures during payload lifting when the suspended load mass
is unexpectedly large or small. A state machine is proposed together with
two safety measures and an update routine for estimating the true mass
if it differs from the assumed mass. Trajectory control with maintained
tension on the cable is proposed and the method is shown to be reliable.
The safety measures proposed seem to be valuable additions to the lifting
maneuver.
